## MANDATORY UNIVERSAL PROTOCOL STANDARD COMPLIANCE - PERMANENTLY EMBEDDED WITH PREVENTION SYSTEM

**CRITICAL**: ALL development MUST strictly follow Universal Protocol Standard with ABSOLUTE NO HARDCODING policy.

**PERMANENT EMBEDDING STATUS**: July 28, 2025 - Complete prevention system now embedded to stop recurring violations forever.

**ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: Any protocol violation is automatically BLOCKED by embedded prevention system. No exceptions allowed.

**🚨 EMBEDDED PREVENTION SYSTEM ACTIVE:**
- **Git Hooks**: .husky/pre-commit and .husky/pre-push block commits/pushes with violations
- **Protocol Scanner**: protocol_check.sh runs comprehensive violation detection automatically  
- **AI Config Enforcement**: server/ai-config-enforcement.ts blocks hardcoded AI configurations at runtime
- **TypeScript Guards**: Compilation fails with any hardcoded values
- **Runtime Validation**: AI operations reject hardcoded API keys and providers
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Violations blocked at write-time, commit-time, push-time, and run-time

**Core Protocol Documents** (permanently embedded in project root):
- `UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md` - Complete protocol specification with mandatory compliance
- `VITE_PROXY_COMPLIANCE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Mandatory Vite proxy and API routing compliance
- `UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL_ENFORCEMENT_SYSTEM.md` - Complete enforcement system documentation
- `PRE_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLIANCE_CHECK.md` - Mandatory checklist before ANY code changes

**Absolute Requirements** (ZERO TOLERANCE):
- NO hardcoding under any circumstances (Math.random, Date.now, static paths, magic numbers)
- Path parameter routing ONLY: `/api/incidents/:id/endpoint` - NO query parameters
- State persistence across ALL workflow stages - evidence must persist through entire workflow
- Mandatory protocol headers in ALL files handling routing/data/schema
- Schema-driven database operations ONLY - use evidenceResponses field, NOT evidenceFiles
- Dynamic configuration for ALL values - NO static fallbacks anywhere
- **ALL API calls from frontend MUST use relative paths: `/api/route` - NO absolute URLs or hardcoded ports**
- **Vite proxy configuration MUST be properly configured for /api routes**
- **Never bypass or remove .husky/pre-commit and .husky/pre-push hooks**
- **Always run protocol_check.sh before EVERY commit or push**

**Automatic Prevention System**:
- PRE_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLIANCE_CHECK.md MUST be completed before ANY code changes
- UNIVERSAL_PROTOCOL_STANDARD.md MUST be consulted before ALL development work
- Any hardcoding violation requires IMMEDIATE STOP and correction
- Protocol compliance verified before testing or completion

**Cost Impact Awareness**: Protocol violations cost user TIME and MONEY. User has ZERO TOLERANCE for repeat violations.

**Enforcement**: All contributors (AI and human) are bound by this permanently embedded protocol. Violations are CRITICAL ERRORS requiring immediate correction.

### CRITICAL VITE MIDDLEWARE ISSUE IDENTIFIED - ROOT CAUSE OF UPDATE FAILURE
- **Date**: July 27, 2025 (Critical Frontend-Backend Communication Issue Diagnosis)
- **User Issue**: Evidence Library updates successful in database but not displayed in UI despite successful API responses

### Previous: SYMPTOM-ONLY EVIDENCE CHECKLIST ENFORCEMENT COMPLETED
- **Date**: January 24, 2025 (Final Strict Symptom-Only Filtering Implementation)
- **User Escalation Resolved**: Critical violation showing irrelevant evidence (SF6 Leak, Refrigerant Leak, Tube Leak) for "pump seal leak" incident
- **Root Cause**: Loose evidence filtering was matching ANY "leak" keyword without contextual relevance checking
- **Strict Enforcement Solution**:
  - **CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE CHECKING**: For "seal leak" incidents, requires BOTH "seal" AND "leak" context in Evidence Library patterns
  - **PENALTY SYSTEM**: Penalizes generic leak evidence without seal context (-8 score penalty)
  - **HIGHER CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS**: Increased from 6 to 12-15 for strict symptom matching
  - **MULTIPLE KEYWORD REQUIREMENT**: Requires multiple keyword matches OR explicit contextual relevance

  - **Multi-Keyword Scoring**: Accumulates scores across failure mode, fault signature, trend data, and questions
  - **Penalty Logic**: Generic leak evidence without seal context gets penalized and excluded
  - **Audit Logging**: "PENALIZED: Tube Leak - generic leak without seal context" for complete transparency

- ✅ Automatic fallback to simulation when AI unavailable
- ✅ Clear error messaging for different user types

## Key Components

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **File Upload**: Users upload files via drag-and-drop interface
2. **Analysis Processing**: Server processes files and stores analysis metadata
3. **Real-time Updates**: Client polls for analysis status updates
4. **Results Display**: Dashboard shows analytics, charts, and detailed analysis history

### UI Components Structure
- **Upload Section**: File upload with drag-and-drop, validation, and processing status
- **Dashboard Section**: Analytics overview with charts and recent analyses
- **History Section**: Searchable, filterable table of all past analyses
- **Processing Status**: Real-time progress tracking for analysis stages

### File Processing Pipeline
1. **Validation**: File type and size validation (10MB limit)
2. **Equipment Context**: Equipment type selection and operating parameter input
3. **Storage**: In-memory storage during processing with equipment-specific data
4. **Analysis**: Enhanced AI processing with equipment-specific root cause analysis
   - Parameter-based insights (temperature, pressure, vibration thresholds)
   - Equipment-specific failure patterns and recommendations
   - Learning insights generation for predictive maintenance
5. **Results**: Contextualized root cause identification with equipment-focused recommendations

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/analyses` - Retrieve analyses with optional filtering (search, priority, date range)
- `POST /api/analyses` - Create new analysis with file upload
- `GET /api/analytics` - Retrieve dashboard analytics and metrics

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **File Upload**: react-dropzone for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with React plugin
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with path mapping
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Linting**: Built-in TypeScript checking

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `db:push` command

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses tsx for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- **Production**: Compiled JavaScript with NODE_ENV=production
- **Database**: Requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for PostgreSQL connection

### Key Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Production build (frontend + backend)
- `npm run start` - Production server
- `npm run db:push` - Apply database schema changes

### Deployment Considerations
- Server serves both API routes and static frontend files
- Database migrations must be run before starting production server
- File uploads are handled in-memory (consider persistent storage for production)
- Session management uses in-memory store (consider Redis for production scaling)

The application is designed for easy deployment on platforms like Replit, with built-in development banner support and Cartographer integration for debugging.
